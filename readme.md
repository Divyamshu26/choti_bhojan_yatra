Choti Bhojan Yatra
📌 Overview

Choti Bhojan Yatra is an initiative aimed at reducing urban food waste by efficiently redistributing surplus or near-expiry food to communities in need. By connecting restaurants, caterers, local producers, and NGOs with volunteers and disaster-relief organizations, the system ensures that food reaches people instead of ending up as waste.
